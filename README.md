# CODSOFT-TASK02-TicTacToeAI
 This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. Players can compete against the bot, which always makes optimal moves. The game board is displayed after each move, and the player can input their position. The game checks for wins, draws, and handles invalid moves gracefully.

 Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)
 
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python, featuring a computer AI opponent powered by the Minimax Algorithm.

The game allows you to play as the "O" player against a highly strategic AI that plays as "X".

The AI ensures that it makes the optimal move at every turn, making the game challenging for the player.

Features

Interactive Console Game: Play against the computer in your terminal.

Minimax Algorithm:
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the best move, making it almost unbeatable.
2-Player Game: Player vs. Computer (you play as "O").

Automatic Draw Detection:
The game detects when there's no more space left and declares a draw if no one has won.

How to Play

The computer goes first and plays as "X". 

You (the player) are "O" and will be prompted to enter the position (1-9) where you'd like to place your marker.

The positions on the board are laid out as follows:

Copy code

1 | 2 | 3

4 | 5 | 6

7 | 8 | 9

The game continues until either the player or the computer wins, or the board is full (draw).

Future Improvements

Add a GUI for a better user experience.

Implement multiplayer mode (player vs player).

Difficulty levels for AI (easy, medium, hard).
