# CODSOFT-TASK02-TicTacToeAI
 This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. Players can compete against the bot, which always makes optimal moves. The game board is displayed after each move, and the player can input their position. The game checks for wins, draws, and handles invalid moves gracefully.
